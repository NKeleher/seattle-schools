## Data Sources

Data for this website were sourced from publicly available resources. Data from SPS is provided via PDF documents on the SPS website. I have transcribed the PDF to comma-separated value (CSV). The raw CSV file can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NKeleher/seattle-schools/main/docs/data/sps-elementary-schools.csv).
